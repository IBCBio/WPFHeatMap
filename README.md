# WPFHeapMap
WPF Heat Map 
My simple quick and dirty approach for generating heap map diagrams using Windows Presentation Foundation and C#. The diagram composed of vectorized object (rectangles) so it can be zoomed without degradation of the quality. Custom pixel shader effect is used for colorizing the heat map. All drawing is done by the WPF so the content generation is reasonable quick. The demonstration program generates 1000 random points and regenerates them every time when the window is resized. Few color schemes are included in the application but it is very easy to add more if needed.
This program is absolutely free. Do whatever you want with this code.
